### Rules of the game

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square
cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and
unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells
that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following
transitions occur:
• Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
• Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
• All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
